# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Configuration
### Shopify Setup

 1. Create a collection the handle 'all' (This is where we are pulling the products from)
 2. Give a unique product type to the main product, the addon products that are bundled with the main product, as well as the card product
 3. If using product filters, tag the product in this format 'category_value' Ex. Color_Blue

### Project Setup
#### Variable Configuration
In /store/actions.js configure these variables
```
//Your Shopify Store URL
const STORE_URL = 'https://happy-box-product-builder-app-test.myshopify.com';

//Shopify Product Type of the Featured Product
const MAIN_PRODUCT_TYPE = 'Box';

//Shopify Product Type of the Addon Products that are bundled with the Featured Product
const ADDON_PRODUCT_TYPE = 'Gift'; 

//Shopify Product Type of the Customizable Card Product
const CARD_PRODUCT_TYPE = 'Card';
```
#### Filter Component
The filter component requires two props passed into it, **options** and **category**
options: an array of options for that category
category: a string with the category name
```
<ProductFilter :options="addonFilterOptions('Color')" category="Color"></ProductFilter>
```
The array of options can be generated by the functions **addonFilterOptions([TAG_CATEGORY])** and **cardFilterOptions([TAG_CATEGORY])**
